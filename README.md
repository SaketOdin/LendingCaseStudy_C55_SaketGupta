## General Information
- This project involves the analysis of Lending Club's loan dataset to identify factors contributing to loan defaults.
## What is the background of your project?
- When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
## What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
- The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
- The project aims to uncover insights into borrower attributes and loan characteristics associated with a higher likelihood of loan defaults
## What is the dataset that is being used?
- The analysis is based on the Lending Club dataset containing loan application information and loan performance data


## Conclusions
In conclusion, our analysis has revealed several key insights into loan defaults and their associated factors. Firstly, borrowers with unverified income sources are significantly more likely to default on their loans, emphasizing the importance of improving income verification processes for lenders. Additionally, specific states such as Nebraska (NE) and Nevada (NV) exhibit notably higher default rates, prompting the need for more comprehensive credit assessments and risk evaluations in these regions.

Furthermore, a clear correlation exists between larger loan amounts, high-interest rates, and increased default rates. Lenders should exercise caution when offering large loans with high interest, as they inherently carry a higher risk of default.

Finally, we noted that borrowers with annual incomes ranging from 16k to 35k exhibit the highest default rates, but as income increases, the default ratio decreases. Additionally, small business and renewable energy loans face higher default rates among specific income ranges, suggesting potential challenges in entrepreneurship and project affordability, respectively. Lenders should consider these insights when designing loan products and risk management strategies to minimize defaults and promote financial stability among borrowers.
